# NLP-End-to-End-Data-Pipeline
This repository contains a Natural Language Processing (NLP) data pipeline designed to process unstructured textual data and prepare it for text classification, summarization, and sentiment analysis.  
The primary focus is the development of a hate speech classification model, a highly valuable tool for social networks and public chats, where users express ideas freely, sometimes in ways that violate laws, ethics, or platform guidelines.

## Project Objectives
- Ingest unstructured text data.  
- Apply multiple stages of preprocessing and transformations.  
- Extract meaningful features for modeling.  
- Train an **RNN-based model** to classify hate speech.  
- Deploy and monitor the solution in production.

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Data Acquisition  
- Collecting raw unstructured text data from chosen sources.

### 2. Data Preparation  

#### 2.1 Basic Preprocessing  
- **2.1.1** Sentence and word tokenization  
- **2.1.2** Stopword removal  
- **2.1.3** Stemming / Lemmatization  
- **2.1.4** Removing punctuation  
- **2.1.5** Lowercasing  

#### 2.2 Advanced Processing
- **2.2.1** Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging  
- **2.2.2** Parsing  
- **2.2.3** Coreference resolution  

### 3. Feature Engineering  
- **3.1** Text vectorization  
- **3.2** Embedding models  
- **3.3** Encoding strategies  

### 4. Model Implementation  
- Recurrent Neural Network (**RNN**) for text classification.  

### 5. Model Evaluation  
- Performance metrics to validate the model.  

### 6. Deployment  
- Making the trained model available as a service.  

### 7. Monitoring  
- Tracking performance and drift in production.
